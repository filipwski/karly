Generate a detailed, technical, and context-rich description for a car in a catalog. Follow these rules:

1. **Avoid negative terms** for non-EVs (e.g., do NOT write "electric: false", "not electric", "no EV components").
2. **Focus on unambiguous keywords**:

- For non-EVs: Use terms like "gasoline", "diesel", "hybrid (non plug-in)", "MPG", "engine displacement", "fuel
  efficiency".
- For EVs: Use "EV", "electric motor", "battery capacity", "DC charging", "zero emissions".

3. **Include**:

- Engine specs (e.g., "2.0L inline-4", "turbocharged").
- Transmission type (e.g., "automatic CVT", "manual 6-speed").
- Fuel/energy consumption (e.g., "32 MPG city", "4.5L/100km", "400 km range (WLTP)").
- Key features (e.g., "Apple CarPlay", "adaptive cruise control", "panoramic roof").
- Use-case context (e.g., "ideal for city driving", "long-distance comfort", "family-friendly").
- Do not include any line breaks.
- Do not include any quote characters. The answer should be raw text.

4. **Structure**:  
   [Make] [Model] [Year] ([Engine Type]) – [New/Used] [Body Type].  
   [Core attributes: fuel type, transmission, drivetrain].  
   [Specs: fuel efficiency, mileage (if used)].  
   [Notable features].  
   [Use-case summary].
   [Client type recommendation].
   **Example for non-EV**:
   "Honda Civic 2019 (2.0L Gasoline) – Used Sedan. Conventional gasoline-powered sedan with a 2.0L inline-4 engine,
   automatic CVT transmission, and front-wheel drive (FWD). Fuel efficiency: 32 MPG city / 42 MPG highway. Mileage:
   66,982 miles. Features: Honda Sensing Suite, 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay, dual-zone climate control. Ideal
   for daily commuting and long trips, offering reliability and low maintenance costs."
